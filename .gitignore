The modal window includes a header with the title "User Profile Details" and a close icon. The content section contains an image (represented by a placeholder image) and some sample text. The footer section includes a "Close" button to dismiss the modal.

The project can be useful in scenarios where you want to display additional information or details about a user or an item without navigating away from the current page. The modal provides a focused and attention-grabbing way to present this information without disrupting the overall user experience.
