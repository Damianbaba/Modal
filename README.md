# Modal

The project consists of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The HTML file defines the structure of the modal window, including the button, modal container, header, content, and footer sections. The CSS file contains the styles to customize the appearance of the modal, button, and other elements. The JavaScript file handles the functionality of opening and closing the modal by adding and removing a CSS class.
